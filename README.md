# Platformer

This example demostrates a way to put things together and create a simple platformer game with a
Gopher!

Use **arrow keys** to run and jump around. Press **ENTER** to restart. (And hush, hush, secret.
Press TAB for slo-mo!)

The retro feel is, other than from the pixel art spritesheet, achieved by using a 160x120px large
off-screen canvas, drawing everything to it and then stretching it to fit the window.

The Gopher spritesheet comes from excellent [Egon Elbre](https://github.com/egonelbre/gophers).
